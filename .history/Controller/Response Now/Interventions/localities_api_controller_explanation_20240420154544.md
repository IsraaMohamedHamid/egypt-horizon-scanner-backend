# Cities API Controller

This JavaScript file is responsible for managing the API endpoints related to cities. It includes functionality for:

- **Creating a new city**: Handles requests to add new cities to the database.
- **Retrieving city details**: Allows fetching details of specific cities, possibly including filters for searching.
- **Updating cities**: Provides methods to update existing city information.
- **Deleting cities**: Implements functionality to remove cities from the system.

## Key Concepts

- **MVC Architecture**: This controller is part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, acting as the intermediary between the user interface and the database models for cities.
- **RESTful API Design**: It likely adheres to REST principles, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manage resources.

### Example Endpoints

- `POST /cities`: Create a new city.
- `GET /cities/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific city.
- `PUT /cities/:id`: Update a specific city.
- `DELETE /cities/:id`: Delete a specific city.

The actual implementation of these endpoints would involve interacting with a database to perform the necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the cities data.
