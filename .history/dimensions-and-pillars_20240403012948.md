### Models

Located under `Model/Digital Avatar/`, these files define the Mongoose schemas for our database entities.

### Controllers

Located under `Controlle/Digital Avatar/`, these files handle the API routing, making use of the models to interact with the database.

### Routes

Located under `Route/Digital Avatar/`, these files handle the API routing, making use of the models to interact with the database.

### Server Setup

- `app.js`: Configures the Express application and links the routes.
- `index.js`: Starts the server and connects to the MongoDB database.
