# EGYPT-HORIZON-SCANNER Project Documentation

## Overview

The EGYPT-HORIZON-SCANNER project is designed to organize and manage data regarding various Digital Avatar essential for analyzing and understanding key factors impacting Egypt's horizon. This includes economic, social, and environmental dimensions, with a focus on detailed issues, source categories, and definitions.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main directories: Model, Controller, and Route, each containing subdirectories for "Digital Avatar" that encapsulate the logic for handling data related to dimensions, issues, and their sources.

### Model

Models define the data structure and schema for the application's core entities:

- `dimension.js`: Manages the data schema for dimensions.
- `dimensionDefinition.js`: Handles the definitions of dimensions.
- `issue.js`: Manages issues within dimensions.
- `issueSourceCategory.js`: Handles the categorization of issue sources.
- `issueDefinition.js`: Manages definitions related to issues.

### Controller

Controllers contain the logic for handling requests, interacting with the models, and returning responses:

- `dimensionController.js`: Controls interactions for dimensions.
- `dimensionDefinitionController.js`: Manages actions related to dimension definitions.
- `issueController.js`: Handles requests related to issues.
- `issueSourceCategoryController.js`: Manages source category actions.
- `issueDefinitionController.js`: Controls interactions for issue definitions.

### Route

Routes define the endpoints of the API that map to the controllers, enabling clients to interact with the application:

- `dimensionRoutes.js`: Endpoints for dimension operations.
- `dimensionDefinitionRoutes.js`: Endpoints for dimension definition operations.
- `issueRoutes.js`: Endpoints for issue operations.
- `issueSourceCategoryRoutes.js`: Endpoints for issue source category operations.
- `issueDefinitionRoutes.js`: Endpoints for issue definition operations.

### Main Application Entry

- `egypt_horizon_scanner.js`: The main entry point for the application, setting up the server and integrating the routes.
