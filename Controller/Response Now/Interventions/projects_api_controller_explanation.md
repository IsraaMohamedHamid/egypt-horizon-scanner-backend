# Projects API Controller

This JavaScript file manages the API interactions for projects within the application. It serves as the bridge between the front-end user interactions and the database operations related to projects. The controller includes functionalities such as:

- **Creating projects**: Accepts details of a new project and adds it to the database.
- **Listing projects**: Provides a list of all available projects, potentially with filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities.
- **Fetching project details**: Retrieves detailed information about a specific project.
- **Updating projects**: Allows for the modification of project details.
- **Deleting projects**: Removes a project from the database.

## Key Concepts

- **MVC Architecture**: As part of the MVC framework, this controller facilitates the flow of data between the project database models and the views that present project information to the user.
- **RESTful API Design**: The controller is likely designed according to REST principles, with endpoints for each type of operation (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### Example Endpoints

- `POST /projects`: Add a new project.
- `GET /projects`: List all projects.
- `GET /projects/:id`: Get details of a specific project.
- `PUT /projects/:id`: Update a project.
- `DELETE /projects/:id`: Delete a project.

These endpoints interact with the project models to perform the necessary database operations, ensuring that the project data is accurately managed.
