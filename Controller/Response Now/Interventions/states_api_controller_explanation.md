# States API Controller

This JavaScript file is dedicated to managing states within the application. It covers a wide range of functionalities related to the manipulation and retrieval of state information. The controller is responsible for:

- **Creating states**: Allows for the addition of new state information into the system.
- **Listing states**: Retrieves a list of all states, potentially with options for filtering or sorting.
- **Fetching state details**: Provides detailed information about a specific state, identified by ID or another unique identifier.
- **Updating states**: Enables the modification of existing state information.
- **Deleting states**: Facilitates the removal of state information from the database.

## Key Concepts

- **MVC Architecture**: This controller functions within the MVC framework, mediating between the state models (which interact with the database) and the views (which present data to the user).
- **RESTful Design**: It likely adheres to RESTful design principles, offering endpoints for each action (Create, Read, Update, Delete) related to state management.

### Example Endpoints

- `POST /states`: Create a new state.
- `GET /states`: Retrieve a list of all states.
- `GET /states/:id`: Fetch details of a specific state.
- `PUT /states/:id`: Update state information.
- `DELETE /states/:id`: Delete a state.

These operations ensure that state data can be effectively managed and utilized within the application.
